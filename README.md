# Make-graphene-drag-grid
Here we take the sigmaD data and organize into a matrix.
First run combine.m in the same folder as the data files to combine them them into a single matrix. This will generate a grid of sigma_D over density space for the quadrant where both layer densities are positive.
Then run gengrid.m to create a grid of sigma_D over the density space including all four quadrants.
